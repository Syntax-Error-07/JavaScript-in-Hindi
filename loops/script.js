// Loops are fundamental constructs in programming that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition or a sequence.

/* 1. For Loop
A for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements.*/

// for(let i=0;i<=5;i++){
//    console.log(i);
// }


/*2. While Loop
A while loop is used when you want to execute a statement or a block of statements as long as a condition is true.*/

// count = 0;
// while (count < 5){
//     console.log(count);
//     count += 1;
// }

/* 3. Do-While Loop
A do-while loop is similar to a while loop, but it checks the condition after executing the loop's body. This means the loop will always execute at least once.*/


// let i = 0;
// do {
//     console.log(i);
//     i++;
// } while (i < 5);
